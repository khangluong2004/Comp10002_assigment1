# Assignment 1 - Comp10002

Basically build a Large Number Calculator for 500-digits integers (can adapt to arbitrary precision), that supports:
1. Addition
2. Multiplication
3. Exponentiation
4. Non-negative subtraction (subtraction with non-negative result)
5. Division

The implementation are not the most efficient, and intended to be easy to read 
and understand (as requested by the assigment). Correctness is guaranteed 
(after multiple test cases).

Better_ass1 contains mostly the same code, with a more efficient 
exponentiation algorithm.

Test files are included, with the input, expected output and the actual
outputs used to compare (start with 'mytest...').
